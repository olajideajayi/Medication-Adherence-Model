# Medication-Adherence-Model

**#Background**
Daily medication is a fact of life for a lot of patients. Too many, however, are not compliant with their medication regimens. Failure to follow doctors' orders has a significant impact on health outcomes and healthcare costs. There are many reasons for patients’ not taking their medications, and many of those reasons stem directly from where and how those patients live and work. In fact, a sizeable percentage of patients are considered to be at moderate-to-high risk for financial insecurity, isolation, housing insecurity, transportation trouble, food insecurity or health illiteracy.

**#Problem**
According to the World Health Organization, increased medication adherence had a far greater impact on population health than any improvements in medical treatments, highlighting the pressing need to focus on the issue. Studies also estimate that non-adherence racks up $300 billion annually in avoidable U.S. healthcare costs, $44 billion of which is linked to cardiovascular disease and statin medication non-adherence. 

 
**#Solution**
The figures above, along with encouragement from government programs such as CMS Stars, are driving the healthcare sector to study adherence patterns using predictive analytics to adjust care managers’ intervention strategies.

This model incorporated synthetic datasets on patient medication, encounters and observation to analyze therapy progress and gaps on a year-to-year basis, covering a ten year follow up period. We used frequency of drug dispensation per patient per year as a proxy for adherence and pegged the threshold cut off at over third quartile of population. According to research, tracking medication fill rates may help measure non-adherence in some patients. 
In 1986, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, a simplified four-question survey demonstrated preliminary data on how the tool could assess non-adherence and overall treatment success in a smaller sample of hypertensive patients. The study found that patients who scored higher on the scale were significantly more likely to have their blood pressure under control after 42 months. Approximately 75 percent of patients who scored high on the scale exhibited adequate blood pressure control compared to only 47 percent of those scoring lower on the scale (p < 0.01).3
